A Medieval Fantasy Role-Playing Game (RPG) offers a vast array of possibilities. Here's a basic outline to get started:

1. **[[Setting]]**: Define the world where your game takes place. Is it a kingdom torn by war? A realm filled with magical creatures? A land ruled by powerful wizards? Establishing the setting helps players immerse themselves in the game world.

2. **[[Character Creation]]**: Allow players to create their own characters. They could choose from various classes such as knights, wizards, rogues, or clerics, each with their own unique abilities and skills. Also, consider including character customization options for appearance and background.

3. **[[Quests and Missions]]**: Design a series of quests and missions for players to embark on. These could range from slaying dragons and rescuing princesses to exploring ancient ruins and solving mysteries. Make sure to include both main storyline quests and optional side quests to keep players engaged.

4. **[[Combat System]]**: Develop a combat system that allows for strategic decision-making. Players should be able to engage in battles with enemies using a variety of weapons, spells, and tactics. Consider including elements like turn-based combat or real-time action, depending on your preference.

5. **[[Exploration]]**: Create a diverse game world filled with interesting locations to explore. From bustling cities and dense forests to eerie dungeons and treacherous mountains, there should be plenty of places for players to discover.

6. **[[Character Progression]]**: Implement a system for character progression and growth. As players complete quests and defeat enemies, they should earn experience points that can be used to level up and improve their abilities. You could also include skill trees or talent systems to allow for further customization.

7. **[[NPCs and Factions]]**: Populate your world with a variety of non-player characters (NPCs) and factions. These could include friendly allies, rival adventurers, powerful rulers, and nefarious villains. Interacting with NPCs and joining factions can offer players new opportunities and shape the course of the game.

8. **[[Choices and Consequences]]**: Incorporate meaningful choices into the game that have consequences on the story and world. Whether it's deciding the fate of a kingdom or forming alliances with different factions, players should feel like their decisions matter.

9. **[[Multiplayer Options]]**: Consider adding multiplayer features to allow players to collaborate with or compete against each other. This could include cooperative quests, player-versus-player battles, or even a persistent online world where players can interact and trade.

10. **[[Polish and Testing]]**: Finally, ensure that your game is polished and thoroughly tested before release. Pay attention to details like graphics, sound, user interface, and overall gameplay experience. Gathering feedback from play testers can help identify areas for improvement.

With these elements in mind, you can start fleshing out the details of your Medieval Fantasy RPG and bring your vision to life!
